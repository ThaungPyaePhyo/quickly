# Quickly

**Quickly** is a job marketplace platform that allows customers to post jobs and service providers to either bid on jobs or accept them instantly. It supports two workflows: **Quick Book** (instant booking) and **Post & Quote** (bidding). Providers can manage their jobs, bids, and statuses via a dedicated dashboard. The system is built for modularity and future extensibility.
